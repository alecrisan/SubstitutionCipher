2. Substitution cipher 

Graphical interface: 
- Windows Forms application
- a text box for each possible input: plain text, encryption key, and cipher text
- a text box for the decryption key (computed only when decrypting)
- 3 buttons: encrypt, decrypt and reset (clear all text boxes) 

Encryption:
- performed when the Encrypt button is clicked
- retrieves the plain text and the encryption key typed by the user
- validates input
- each letter from the plain text is replaced with the corresponding letter in the cipher
alphabet (encryption key)

Decryption:
- performed when the Decrypt button is clicked
- retrieves the cipher text and the encryption key typed by the user
- validates input
- compute the decryption key using the normal alphabet and the encryption key
- we replace the corresponding letters but this time from the decryption key that we found 

Auxiliary methods:
- validate text: check if the user followed the requirements - only letters of the 
english alphabet and whitespaces allowed (27 characters)
- validate key: check if all the letters of the alphabet are there, and nothing else 
(except whitespace)
- validate input: check if the text and the key are valid

Examples to run:
1) ENCRYPT
plain text: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
encryption key: " YHKQGVXFOLUAPWMTZECJDBSNRI" 

=> cipher text: "JFG ZDOKU HEMSW VMN LDPTC MBGE JFG AYIR QMX"

2) DECRYPT
cipher text: "GIUIFG CEI IPRC TPNN DU CEI QPRCNI"
encryption key: " PHQGIUMEAYLNOFDXJKRCVSTZWB"

=> decryption key: " IZTOHNDBEQRKGLMACSVWFUYPJX"
   plain text: "defend the east wall of the castle"
